    "Taking large powers of large matrices as in this example can be a computationally intractable task.  However, if $M$ has $p$ eigenvectors, where $p$ = $\\text{dim}(M)$, then it is possible to switch to an eigenbasis, do the computation there, and then convert back to the original basis.  This method - if possible for the matrices at hand - is far more efficient than simple taking a matrix and raising it to a large power, as only the eigenvalues need to be operated on, allowing for a sizeable computational speedup.  \n",
